# Using Git

We have used Git as version control system on GitHub to develop and share WwC materials.

> What's the point of learning this?

Well, probably you have been working on a paper or with some kind of data and you have end up with several folders, run out of ideas on how to name them, forgotten what was what, and erased accidentally that folder with the right version, or you just cannot go back to that previous version you had that was much better. If you were working with others, multiply that exponentially. Not to speak of what did who, tell the difference between two versions, etc. Git/GitHub helps you to overcome these problems and to keep track of the work done. And it is not so difficult ;-)

This tutorial will help you to set up Git on your computer and do most basic operations.

## What is Git

> Git is a widely used source code management system for software development. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

> Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

This means that you can set up a repository even in your laptop to work locally.

## Git/GitHub

> GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.<sup id="a1">[2](#f2)</sup>

GitHub also comes with a very complete documentation, and it has a huge community. So getting help is relatively easy. We will follow GitHub's [documentation](https://help.github.com) to get started.

## Installing git

To get started follow the instructions provided in GitHub's [bootcamp](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

All work with Git can be done from the command line. However, there are different GUIs that will help you to get familiar with Git.

Take a look at GitHub's [desktop App]() (available for Windows and Mac).
